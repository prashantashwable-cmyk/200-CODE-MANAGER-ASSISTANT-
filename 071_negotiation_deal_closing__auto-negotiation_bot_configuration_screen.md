Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. Where the brief's 'auto-negotiate with customer and make deal automatically' becomes real: a bounded, monitored bot backed by a human escalation path and a clean contract close. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Auto-Negotiation Bot Configuration Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- Deal-closing-specific configuration layered on top of the general Conversation AI Bot settings: acceptable final-price floor per deal, maximum number of negotiation rounds before mandatory human handoff, tone/persona for this specific high-stakes conversation type
- Scenario library of common objections (price too high, comparing to a competitor, wants to delay) each mapped to an approved response strategy
- Toggle for whether the bot can independently close a deal at the floor price, or must always get a final human nod even at an acceptable price
- Live dashboard of bots currently negotiating, with a manual 'take over' button always available

### Data this screen touches
- `deal_price_floor`
- `max_negotiation_rounds`
- `objection_scenario_map`
- `auto_close_authority_flag`
- `active_negotiations_count`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This configuration directly inherits and further restricts the discount and margin-floor guardrails already established in the Quotation Engine's Pricing Rules screen — a negotiation can never independently arrive at a price the Cost Breakdown logic wouldn't itself allow
- Every negotiation round increments a counter; hitting max_negotiation_rounds always forces human handoff regardless of how close the conversation seems to a close, preventing an endless automated back-and-forth
- auto_close_authority_flag defaults to off for a new deployment, requiring Admin to deliberately opt into full automated closing only once trust in the bot's behavior is established

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Customer's objection doesn't match any scenario in the library (genuinely novel concern): low-confidence match always escalates to human rather than forcing a poor-fit canned response
- Admin sets max_negotiation_rounds very low, causing most conversations to hand off almost immediately: this is a valid conservative choice, not an error, so the system respects it without nagging Admin to change it
- A negotiation is already in progress when Admin changes these settings: apply new settings only to negotiations started after the change, letting in-flight conversations finish under consistent rules

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 7 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, brightened gold `#D4A855` and emerald `#2E9B78` accents), **Orbital** (a mission-control mood — deep space-black `#0B0E14` background, monospace telemetry-style labels, a fine dot-grid texture, brightened gold `#D9AE5C` and emerald `#35B48A` accents), **Lithium** (a matte, automotive-dashboard mood — flat near-black `#101012` surfaces, oversized clean numerals, desaturated matte gold `#C99A52` and emerald `#2E8968` accents, almost no shadow), **Pure** (an extreme-minimalist mood — pure white `#FFFFFF` background, hairline dividers instead of shadows, maximum whitespace, the same gold `#B8873D`/emerald `#0E4B3D` as Light mode used far more sparingly), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting, mapping to Light/Alabaster or Dark). All 7 modes keep the *same* AIEC gold-and-emerald brand identity underneath — only mood, texture, density, and typography change between them, never the core brand colors, so the app never looks like it's borrowed someone else's visual identity. Full token values for all seven modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: settings):** Group related settings under clear section headers with generous spacing between groups — settings screens fail when everything looks like one undifferentiated list. Toggle switches right-aligned and consistently sized. Always show the current value next to a setting's name (e.g., "Reminder cadence: 3 days before due") rather than hiding it until tapped into a sub-screen. Any destructive or high-consequence action (deactivating a partner, changing a margin floor, revoking a session) gets distinct visual treatment (e.g., Error Red text or icon) and a confirmation step — never sits visually identical to a routine, reversible setting.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] No automated negotiation can ever settle below the true cost-based price floor
- [ ] A human always regains control within a bounded, predictable number of rounds if a deal doesn't close cleanly
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Auto-Negotiation Bot Configuration Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
