Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. This is the single-person monitoring nerve center the brief calls for: one map, every moving part of the business, visible at a glance. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Route Optimization Suggestion Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- When a new lead needing a follow-up visit or a new job needing a technician comes in, this screen suggests the best-matched staff member ranked by proximity, current workload, and relevant skill tags
- Ranked list alongside the map, each candidate showing distance, ETA, and current task load
- One-tap Assign action that notifies the selected staff member instantly
- Manual override always available — the suggestion is advisory, Admin makes the final call

### Data this screen touches
- `task_id`
- `candidate_staff_ids[]`
- `distance_km`
- `current_workload_count`
- `suggested_rank`

### Business logic & automation rules
- Ranking weighs proximity, current open-task count, and (for technicians) skill-tag match, combined into a single suggested order — never proximity alone, since a nearby but overloaded staffer is often the wrong pick
- Assigning a task automatically removes it from any 'unassigned' queue and notifies the staff member with full task context
- If no eligible staff member is within a reasonable radius, the screen says so plainly rather than forcing a bad match

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- Two Admins view the same unassigned task simultaneously and both try to assign it: the first assignment wins, the second Admin sees an immediate 'already assigned to X' notice
- Best-ranked candidate is on approved leave today: exclude them from ranking automatically rather than suggesting an unavailable person
- A newly onboarded staff member with zero history: rank fairly using proximity and skills alone, don't penalize for lack of track record

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 7 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, brightened gold `#D4A855` and emerald `#2E9B78` accents), **Orbital** (a mission-control mood — deep space-black `#0B0E14` background, monospace telemetry-style labels, a fine dot-grid texture, brightened gold `#D9AE5C` and emerald `#35B48A` accents), **Lithium** (a matte, automotive-dashboard mood — flat near-black `#101012` surfaces, oversized clean numerals, desaturated matte gold `#C99A52` and emerald `#2E8968` accents, almost no shadow), **Pure** (an extreme-minimalist mood — pure white `#FFFFFF` background, hairline dividers instead of shadows, maximum whitespace, the same gold `#B8873D`/emerald `#0E4B3D` as Light mode used far more sparingly), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting, mapping to Light/Alabaster or Dark). All 7 modes keep the *same* AIEC gold-and-emerald brand identity underneath — only mood, texture, density, and typography change between them, never the core brand colors, so the app never looks like it's borrowed someone else's visual identity. Full token values for all seven modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: map):** Full-bleed map as the base layer (built on the Google Maps AI Chip / Maps integration available in AI Studio's Build mode). Never cover the map with a full-screen modal for details — use a floating card or bottom sheet that leaves the map visible and in context underneath. Pins are color-coded by type/status with a small always-visible legend. Cluster pins at low zoom and expand smoothly on zoom-in rather than letting the map become an illegible pile of markers. Any list-under-a-map (e.g., nearby results) uses a draggable bottom sheet, not a separate screen.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] Every new task gets a sensible top suggestion without the Admin needing to manually check everyone's location and workload
- [ ] Double-assignment of the same task to two people is structurally impossible
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Route Optimization Suggestion Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.

## Module 2 Checkpoint — before you start the next module

You've now finished all 10 screens in **Module 2: Admin Command Center — Live Operations Map**. Before moving on to Module 3:

1. Click through every screen you just built in this module, start to finish, once, as if you were the actual user.
2. Spot-check 2-3 of the most important screens from earlier modules — you don't need to re-test everything back to Prompt 001, just confirm nothing visibly broke.
3. If anything looks wrong, send one more small, targeted prompt to fix it now. Don't carry a visible bug forward into the next module — regressions compound, and they're far cheaper to fix the moment you spot them than 50 screens later.
4. Optional but recommended: this is a natural point to download a ZIP backup or note your current AI Studio checkpoint/version, so you always have a known-good rollback point behind you.

This costs about two minutes and saves far more than that in confused debugging later.
