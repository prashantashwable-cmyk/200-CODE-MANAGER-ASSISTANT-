Continue building **ALL INDIA ELEVATORS COMPANY (AIEC)**, the mobile-first, multi-role elevator business platform for owner Mr. Prashant Vasant Wable. The brief's 'one page for automatically new workers aggregation and data collection, recruitment, trainings, SOP' — the pipeline that keeps AIEC's asset-light workforce growing without manual HR overhead. Several screens already exist in this build — do not rebuild, restyle, or restructure anything outside this one screen. If you need a shared component (a button style, a card, the Ascension Line progress element, the map component), extend or reuse the existing one rather than creating a second, inconsistent version of it.

Now build the **Background/Document Verification Screen** screen, used by: **Admin**.

### Functional requirements
- Verification queue for ID documents, certifications, and any reference checks conducted for applicants moving toward final approval
- Third-party verification status where applicable (e.g., an external ID verification API), alongside manual Admin verification for items that need direct human judgment
- Clear pass/fail/pending status per verification item
- Cannot reach final Offer approval until all required verification items for that specific role are resolved

### Data this screen touches
- `applicant_id`
- `verification_item`
- `verification_method`
- `verification_status`
- `verified_by`

### Business logic & automation rules
- This screen structurally gates the Offer & Onboarding Agreement screen — no offer can be extended until required verification items for the relevant role (which differ between Surveyor, Technician, and Supplier per their respective onboarding wizards' specific document requirements) are resolved, protecting the business from the real operational and liability risks of an inadequately vetted field partner
- Required verification items differ meaningfully by role (a technician's safety certifications and insurance matter in a way a customer-facing surveyor's don't as centrally), so this screen's required-item checklist is role-aware rather than one-size-fits-all
- This is a deliberate, serious checkpoint reflecting that the no-liability, asset-light aggregator model's real protection against risk fundamentally depends on genuinely vetting the external partners AIEC brings under its brand, not merely collecting documents without real verification

### Edge cases & validation to handle
- A required document is genuinely difficult for an applicant to obtain quickly through no fault of their own (e.g., a document processing delay at a government office): support a documented temporary conditional approval path with a firm follow-up deadline, rather than either indefinitely blocking a good applicant or ignoring the requirement entirely
- Third-party verification service is temporarily unavailable: support manual fallback verification with appropriate Admin diligence, rather than the entire recruitment pipeline stalling on an external service outage
- A verification item comes back with a concerning result (e.g., a reference check reveals a real red flag): ensure this appropriately and clearly blocks the offer, with the reasoning preserved in the applicant's record for accountability and consistency

### UI / design requirements
**AIEC Design System — "Alabaster & Ascension" (premium royal-white theme)**
- Palette: Alabaster White #F8F6F1 base, pure White #FFFFFF cards, Charcoal Ink #2A2723 text, Antique Gold #B8873D primary accent, Royal Emerald #0E4B3D secondary accent. Keep Error Red #B23B3B reserved strictly for genuine errors/safety alerts — never decorative.
- Type (Latin/English): "Fraunces" (serif, Google Font) for headings/hero numbers, "Plus Jakarta Sans" (Google Font) for all UI/body text, "IBM Plex Mono" tabular figures for money and KPI numbers.
- Type (Devanagari/Hindi & Marathi): "Fraunces" and "Plus Jakarta Sans" do NOT cover Devanagari glyphs — never let Hindi/Marathi text silently fall back to a generic system font. Pair "Martel" (Google Font) for headings and "Hind" (Google Font) for UI/body text in Hindi or Marathi, matching the same heading/body weight relationship as the Latin pair. Keep IBM Plex Mono for all numerals in every language — India's digital finance UI uses Western digits (0-9) regardless of the surrounding script, so amounts don't need a separate numeral font per language. All user-facing text (labels, buttons, headings, messages, notification templates) must render in the user's selected language (English / Hindi / Marathi) via the app's translation system — never hardcoded in one language.
- Icons: Phosphor Icons or Lucide, thin 1.5px line-weight, rounded caps, tinted Royal Emerald by default and Antique Gold when active/selected.
- Cards: 16-20px corner radius, soft ambient shadow (never a harsh flat drop-shadow), 1px hairline border tinted gold at ~15% opacity.
- Grid: 8pt spacing throughout, mobile-first single column, 16-24px screen margins, sticky bottom action bar for primary CTAs, minimum 48x48px touch targets.
- Theme modes: build every color as a CSS custom property (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-accent-primary`, `--color-accent-secondary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-border`) — never a hardcoded hex value in a component — so the whole app can switch instantly between 4 modes, stored as the signed-in user's own saved preference: **Light/Alabaster** (default — the warm-ivory palette above), **Snow White** (a crisper, cooler, brighter variant — pure `#FFFFFF` background, near-black `#1F2124` text, tighter shadows), **Dark** (warm near-black `#1A1815` background and `#242019` cards, soft off-white `#F0EDE6` text, and *brightened* accent colors — gold `#D4A855`, emerald `#2E9B78` — since the light-mode gold/emerald values lose contrast on a dark background), and **System** (follows the device's own OS-level light/dark setting). Full token values for all four modes live in `000_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — use them exactly, don't invent new ones per screen.
- Signature element — "the Ascension Line": a thin gold vertical rail that fills upward as progress is made, literally a stylized elevator floor-indicator. Use it for every stage-based UI in the app: CRM pipeline, installation SOP steps, onboarding wizards, training progress, negotiation rounds. This is the one motif that should appear, consistently styled, across the entire app, and it should use the `--color-accent-primary` token so it looks correct in every theme mode automatically.
- Motion: subtle and purposeful only — a completed Ascension Line step gets a brief warm glow, cards fade-and-rise on load. No bouncy/spring physics; this is a premium, safety-adjacent brand, not a playful consumer app.
- Voice: confident, clear, warm but not casual, in whichever of the three languages is active. Save exclamation marks for genuine celebratory moments (a deal won, a badge earned).

**Layout-specific guidance for this screen (layout pattern: list):** Establish one consistent row anatomy (leading icon or avatar, primary line, secondary line, trailing status/value) and repeat it exactly across every row so the list reads instantly once learned. Sticky search/filter bar pinned above the scrolling content. Support swipe actions on mobile where a natural quick action exists (e.g., swipe to call, swipe to reassign). Design the empty state (zero results, zero data yet) with the same care as a populated list — a clear icon, one calm sentence, and a next action, never just blank space. Use skeleton row placeholders while loading, and paginate or virtualize any list that could realistically grow large.

### This screen is done when:
- [ ] No partner joins AIEC's network under-vetted for the real risks their specific role carries
- [ ] Verification requirements are correctly and consistently tailored to what each specific role actually needs checked
- [ ] The screen matches the AIEC Alabaster & Ascension design system (colors, type, the Ascension Line motif where applicable) rather than a generic default theme
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states are all explicitly designed, not left blank or default
- [ ] The screen is fully usable at a mobile viewport width first, then adapted upward for wider screens

### Scope for this prompt
Touch only what's needed for the Background/Document Verification Screen screen and any shared component it must genuinely reuse. Do not modify unrelated screens, do not restyle already-built screens "while you're in there," and do not refactor the data model beyond what this screen genuinely requires. If a larger refactor actually seems necessary, stop and say so rather than doing it silently.
